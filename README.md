# stalin-sort
Stalin sort in multiple languages, contributions are welcome!

# Motivation

This repo is motivated by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/CodingKaiser/status/1445635475599810572), it contains a reference Python implementation. Since stalin sort is quite fun, why not implementing it in multiple languages? Hence this repo is created.

It is also fun to implement the same algorithm in different languages and it is an opportunitiy for me to learn different programming languages as well.
